# AWS CDK Patterns (L3)

Patterns allow you to provision resources that are commonly used together. Construct patterns are designed to help you provision multiple resources based on common patterns with a limited amount of knowledge in a concise manner. s3deploy.BucketDeployment is a great example of a high-level construct. The L3 construct takes a bucket as an argument and uploads your code.
