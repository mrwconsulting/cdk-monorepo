# CDK Monorepo Starter Project

### CDK Monorepo
A monorepo (short for monolithic repository) is a software development strategy where code for many applications, which may or may not be mutually dependent, is stored in the same version-controlled repository.

Some advantages of the monorepo approach are:

- Ease of code reuse — it is easy to abstract shared behavior into common libraries.

- Simplified dependency management — third-party dependencies are easily shared.
Atomic commits across multiple applications — you can refactor multiple applications at once with a single commit.

- Single source of truth — there’s only one version of each dependency.
Unified CI/CD — a standardized process can build and deploy every application in the repository.

This project serves as a template to easily get started on the CDK monorepo journey.

### What does a Lerna repo look like?

File structure that looks like this:

```
my-lerna-monorepo/
  package.json
  packages/
    package-1/
      package.json
    package-2/
      package.json
```
